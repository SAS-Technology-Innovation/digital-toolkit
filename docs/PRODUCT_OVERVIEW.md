# SAS Digital Toolkit — Product Overview

## The Challenge

Schools today rely on dozens — sometimes hundreds — of educational technology applications. At Singapore American School, managing this growing ecosystem has meant juggling spreadsheets, email threads, and institutional memory spread across teams. Key questions were hard to answer:

- **What tools do we actually have?** No single source of truth existed. Different divisions tracked apps in different places.
- **Who is responsible for each tool?** When a teacher had a question about an app, finding the right contact meant asking around.
- **Are we getting value from what we pay for?** Renewal decisions were made without structured feedback from the people who use the tools every day.
- **Is our data safe?** Compliance and privacy information was scattered or undocumented.

The Digital Toolkit was built to close these gaps — giving every stakeholder a clear, unified view of the school's technology landscape.

## What the Digital Toolkit Does

### A Single Source of Truth

Every application at SAS lives in one place: searchable, filterable, and organized by division, category, department, and audience. Whether you are a teacher looking for a classroom tool, a TIC managing your division's portfolio, or an administrator making budget decisions — you start here.

Apps are organized the way people think about them:

- **Whole School** tools that everyone uses
- **Division-specific** tools for Elementary, Middle, and High School
- **Department tools** grouped by who manages them
- **Enterprise apps** that form the school's core infrastructure

### Ownership and Accountability

Every app has a clear chain of responsibility:

- **Owner** — the person accountable for the tool
- **Champion** — advocates who support users and share expertise
- **TIC Manager** — provides technical oversight

When a teacher needs help or has feedback, they can see exactly who to contact — right from the app's detail page.

### Structured Renewal Workflow

The toolkit replaces informal renewal conversations with a structured, transparent process:

1. **Teachers submit assessments** sharing how they use the tool, what works, and what does not
2. **AI aggregates feedback** to surface patterns across submissions
3. **TICs review and recommend** based on usage data, teacher input, and strategic fit
4. **Approvers make informed decisions** with full context — not just a vendor pitch

Every step is tracked. Every decision is documented. The rationale lives alongside the data.

### Data-Driven Decision Making

The admin experience is built for people who manage portfolios, not just databases. Inspired by tools like Notion, the data table lets authorized users:

- Click any cell to edit it inline
- See contracts, costs, compliance, and assessment data side by side
- Filter, sort, and toggle columns to focus on what matters
- Export data when they need it elsewhere

This is not a reporting tool you visit once a quarter. It is a working surface for day-to-day management.

### Compliance and Risk Visibility

For every application, the toolkit tracks:

- Privacy policy, terms of service, and GDPR documentation
- Risk rating and assessment status
- SSO and authentication capabilities
- Vendor contact and support information

When a parent asks "is this tool safe?" or an auditor requests compliance documentation, the answer is one search away.

## Who It Serves

### Teachers and Staff
Discover available tools, find tutorials, submit feedback during renewal cycles, and request new applications — all in one place.

### Technology Integration Coordinators (TICs)
Manage your division's technology portfolio. Review teacher feedback, generate AI summaries, and make data-backed recommendations to leadership.

### Approvers and Directors
Make renewal and budget decisions with full context: teacher sentiment, usage data, cost information, and TIC recommendations — presented clearly, not buried in email chains.

### Administrators and EdTech Team
Full control over the application catalog: inline editing of any field, user and role management, data sync between systems, and compliance tracking.

## The Gaps We Close

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Apps tracked in disconnected spreadsheets | One searchable catalog, always current |
| No clear ownership per tool | Owner, Champion, and TIC Manager assigned to every app |
| Renewal decisions based on vendor pitch or gut feeling | Structured teacher feedback with AI summaries and TIC review |
| Compliance info scattered or undocumented | Privacy, terms, GDPR, and risk ratings on every app record |
| No visibility into what other divisions use | Cross-division discovery with audience and category filters |
| Manual data entry across multiple systems | Bidirectional sync between Supabase and Google Sheets |
| Role confusion about who can do what | Four clear roles: Staff, TIC, Approver, Admin |

## Design Principles

- **Built for SAS**: Brand colors, division structure, and workflows match how the school operates
- **Permission-aware**: Every feature respects role boundaries — staff see what they need, admins see everything
- **Low friction**: Magic link authentication, inline editing, AI-assisted summaries — minimize clicks, maximize clarity
- **Transparent**: Every renewal decision has a paper trail. Every app has a visible owner. Every field is auditable.
