## For Everyone: Discovering Apps

### The Dashboard

When you sign in, you land on the Dashboard — a division-organized view of every application at SAS.

- **Tabs** at the top let you switch between Whole School, Elementary, Middle School, and High School
- **Enterprise Apps** appear at the top with a gold accent — these are school-wide platforms everyone uses
- **Apps Everyone Can Use** are site-licensed tools available across the selected division
- **Department Apps** are grouped by department with counts

### Searching

Use the search bar to find apps by name, category, subject, department, or audience. Results update as you type.

### App Details

Click any app card to open its detail view. Here you will find:

- Description and category
- Website and tutorial links
- Division, audience, and grade levels
- SSO and mobile app availability
- Who owns and champions the tool
- Vendor and contract information (if you have access)

### My Apps

If you are logged in and assigned to any applications (as Owner, Champion, or TIC Manager), a **My Apps** tab appears on the Dashboard showing your responsibilities grouped by role.

## For Teachers and Staff

### Browsing the App Catalog

The **App Catalog** (`/apps`) provides a searchable, filterable list of all applications. Use the filters to narrow by:

- Category (Learning Management, Assessment, STEM, etc.)
- Department
- Audience (Teachers, Students, Parents, Staff)
- Division

### Requesting a New App

Need a tool that is not in the catalog? Visit **Request App** (`/requests`) to submit a request. The EdTech team reviews all requests.

### Submitting Renewal Feedback

During renewal cycles, teachers are invited to submit assessments for apps they use. Visit **Renewals > Submit Assessment** to:

- Select the app you want to evaluate
- Share how you use it and how often
- Rate its impact on teaching and learning
- Recommend whether to retain, replace, or retire it

Your feedback is aggregated with other teachers' input and directly informs renewal decisions.

---

## For TICs (Technology Integration Coordinators)

Everything above, plus:

### Reviewing Teacher Feedback

Visit **Renewals > TIC Review** to see all apps with teacher assessments. For each app, you can:

- Read individual teacher submissions
- Generate an AI summary that synthesizes patterns across all feedback
- Add your own technical and strategic context
- Submit a recommendation (Retain, Retire, or Under Review)

Your recommendation, along with the teacher feedback and AI summary, goes to the Approver for final decision.

### Managing App Data

On the **Admin** page, the data table supports inline editing. If you have TIC or Admin access:

- **Click any cell** to edit it — product name, category, vendor, contract dates, costs, compliance URLs, and more
- **Boolean fields** (SSO, Mobile App, Enterprise) toggle with a switch
- **Select fields** (Status, Category, Division) open a dropdown
- **Text and dates** edit inline with a text input
- Changes save automatically. A confirmation toast appears after each edit.

Use the **Columns** button to show or hide fields. The table remembers your sort and filter preferences.

---

## For Approvers and Directors

Everything above, plus:

### Making Renewal Decisions

Visit **Renewals > Approver** to see apps awaiting your decision. Each app shows:

- Aggregated teacher feedback
- AI-generated summary
- TIC recommendation and rationale
- Cost and contract information

You can approve renewal, retire the app, or flag it for further review. Every decision is recorded with your rationale.

---

## For Administrators

Everything above, plus:

### Full Data Management

The Admin panel gives you complete control over the application catalog:

- **Inline editing** of all 50+ fields per application
- **Data sync** — pull from Google Sheets, push changes back
- **Duplicate detection** — find and merge duplicate records
- **CSV export** — download the full catalog for reporting

### User Management

Visit **Admin > Users** to:

- View all registered users
- Change roles (Staff, TIC, Approver, Admin)
- Activate or deactivate accounts
- Search and filter the user list

### App Ownership

From any app's detail modal, admins can:

- Assign or change the Owner
- Add or remove Champions
