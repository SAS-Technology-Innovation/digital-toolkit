- Department cards with app counts and icons

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Google Account with access to Google Apps Script
- Google Sheets document with application data
- Node.js installed (for development)

### Local Setup & Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SAS-Technology-Innovation/digital-toolkit.git
    cd digital-toolkit
    ```

2.  **Connect to your Apps Script project:**
    To link your local environment to your Google Apps Script project, you need to create a `.clasp.json` file. This file is intentionally not stored in the repository.

    -   First, find your **Script ID** in the Apps Script editor under **Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) > IDs**.
    -   Then, run the `clasp clone` command:
    ```bash
    npx @google/clasp clone "YOUR_SCRIPT_ID"
    ```
    This will create the `.clasp.json` file and pull the latest code from the cloud, ensuring your local project is correctly linked.

3.  **Log in to clasp:**
    If you haven't already, log in to your Google account.
    ```bash
    npm run login
    ```

4.  **Start developing:**
    Use the npm scripts in `package.json` to push, pull, and deploy your code.

## üìã Configuration

### Google Sheets Setup
Your Google Sheet must contain these columns:
- **Active**: TRUE/FALSE (only TRUE apps are displayed)
- **Product**: Application name
- **Division**: School divisions (Elementary, Middle, High, or combinations)
- **Department**: Department name (used for grouping)
- **Subject**: Subject area
- **License Type**: License type (Site, Individual, Enterprise, etc.)
- **Licenses**: Number of licenses (numeric)
- **Category**: Application category
- **Website**: Application URL
- **Spend**: Cost information

### Apps Script Configuration

Configuration is managed using **Script Properties** to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.

1.  Open the Apps Script project by running `npm run open`.
2.  In the left-hand menu, click on **Project Settings** (the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon).
3.  Scroll down to the **Script Properties** section.
4.  Click **Add script property**.
5.  Add the following two properties:
    -   **Property:** `SPREADSHEET_ID`
        **Value:** `your-google-sheets-id`
    -   **Property:** `SHEET_NAME`
        **Value:** `your-sheet-name`

## üîß Development

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run login     # Login to Google Apps Script
npm run push      # Push code changes
npm run deploy    # Create new deployment
npm run pull      # Pull latest from Apps Script
npm run logs      # View execution logs
npm run open      # Open Apps Script editor
```

### Project Structure
```
digital-toolkit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code.js                 # Apps Script backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html             # Frontend dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appsscript.json       # Apps Script configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # npm scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .clasp.json          # clasp configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.yml    # Auto-deployment
```

### Business Logic

**Division Assignment:**
- Apps are assigned to divisions based on the Division column
- Apps with multiple divisions listed become "Whole School" apps
- "School Operations" department apps are treated as whole school
- Site/School/Enterprise licenses appear in "Apps Everyone Can Use"

**Department Filtering:**
- Only valid department names are shown as department cards
- Division names (Elementary, Middle, High) are filtered out
- Empty, "N/A", or placeholder departments are excluded

## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)
The repository includes automatic deployment via GitHub Actions:
1.  **Add GitHub Secrets:**
    Go to your repository's **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions** and add the following three secrets:
    -   `CLASP_CREDENTIALS`: Your local clasp authentication token. Get it by running `npm run login` and then `cat ~/.config/clasp/.clasprc.json`.
    -   `APPS_SCRIPT_ID`: The ID of your Google Apps Script project. Find it in the Apps Script editor under **Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) > IDs**.
    -   `APPS_SCRIPT_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: The stable deployment ID for your web app. Find it under **Deploy > Manage deployments**.

    > **Note:** The `.clasp.json` file is not committed to the repository. It is generated dynamically during the GitHub Actions workflow. For local development, this file will be created when you run `npm run login` and `npm run pull` or `npm run clone`.

3. **Auto-Deploy:**
   - Pushes to `main` branch automatically deploy
   - Manual deployment via Actions tab

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Push and deploy manually
npm run push
npm run deploy
```

## üì± Usage

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Visit your deployed Google Apps Script web app URL
2. **Navigate Divisions**: Click tabs to view different school divisions
3. **Browse Apps**: View apps in "Everyone Can Use" and department sections
4. **Access Apps**: Click app names to visit application websites
5. **View Details**: Check tags for categories, subjects, and license types

## üé® Customization

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Custom CSS variables for school branding
- Lucide icons for visual elements

### Department Icons
Icons are automatically assigned based on department names:
- Technology/IT: Monitor icon
- English/Language: Book icon
- Math: Calculator icon
- Science: Flask icon
- Arts/Music: Palette icon
- PE/Athletics: Activity icon
- Library: Library icon
- Counseling: Heart icon

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Domain Restricted**: Web app access limited to SAS domain
- **@OnlyCurrentDoc**: Limited to current document permissions
- **No Data Storage**: No persistent data storage in Apps Script
- **Read-Only Sheet Access**: Real-time data from Google Sheets

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Script not found" error:**
- Verify `scriptId` in `.clasp.json`
- Ensure you have access to the Apps Script project

**Google Sheets permission error:**
- Check that the spreadsheet ID is correct
- Verify sheet name matches configuration
- Ensure the Apps Script has read access to the sheet

**Deployment fails:**
- Check Google Apps Script editor for syntax errors
- Verify all files are valid
- Ensure proper OAuth scopes in `appsscript.json`
